# Newsletter subscribe plugin - NSP
## Why this?
As many people I wanted to create a newsletter to engage with a community im looking forward to create. This normally needs a form to subscribe and provider usually give you one to embed in your web (allowing 0 configurations or behind a paywall)

Here is were I had one of those 'Aja!' moments that people talk about and decide that I could build a configurable form that people can use free to connect to their providers API.

## How to use it.
1. Download de zip file
2. Upload it in the plugin section
3. Configure plugin using the settings view (HIGLY recommended to configure some css)
4. Add the form where you want it to show using the shortcode `[NSP-form]`
